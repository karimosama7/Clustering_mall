# Customers Clustering

## Overview
This project demonstrates customer segmentation using clustering techniques. Clustering is used to group customers based on various features, helping businesses understand customer behavior and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

## Files
- `customers-clustering.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook contains the full analysis, including data preprocessing, clustering model implementation, and visualization of the customer segments.

## Prerequisites
Before running the notebook, ensure that you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`

You can install the required libraries by running:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## Project Structure
1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
    - Handles missing values, data normalization, and feature engineering.
2. **Clustering Algorithms**:
    - Implements clustering algorithms like K-Means, Agglomerative Clustering, etc.
    - Evaluation of cluster quality using metrics such as the silhouette score.
3. **Visualization**:
    - Visualizes customer segments using 2D and 3D plots.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository or download the `customers-clustering.ipynb` file.
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook customers-clustering.ipynb
    ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to preprocess the data, run clustering algorithms, and visualize the results.

## Results
- The notebook provides detailed insights into customer groups, including their demographics and purchase behavior.
- Visualizations are included to show how customers are clustered based on features.

## Conclusion
Clustering customers can help businesses make data-driven decisions regarding product development, marketing strategies, and customer service improvements.
